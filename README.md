### Overview of My Submission
As students all over the world were forced to attend online classes, YouTube became a popular go-to option for a lot of students (like me üò¨) who were unable to understand online lectures.

While studying via YouTube videos, I often found myself getting distracted (by Minecraft videos üòÖ) and wasted a good number of hours trapped in the recommended videos.

To overcome that we came up with this idea of having a companion application where you can create categories and add a bunch of channels which will allow you to focus on content which is necessary and avoid unnecessary distractions.

To make the application more useful, we integrated Azure's Cognitive Services for 

- Speech to Text for generating transcriptions
- Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining for rating the video (because YouTube removed dislike counts ‚òπÔ∏è)
- Azure ML to train an AI powered Quiz Generator
- Summary of the video in text format (so that you do not waste time on the wrong video ü§ì)
